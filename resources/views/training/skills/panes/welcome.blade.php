<h3>Welcome to the training skills section</h3>
<p>The SU requires us to keep accurate records of the membership's abilities, to ensure we're safe and following the relavent standards.
     These records are also used to plan training to ensure skills are retained within the membership.</p>
<p>Here you may browse the avaliable skills and what they require. If you feel eligable for any skill click the 'Apply for Skill' below,
    the Training and Safety Officer will review your application.</p>
<p>Members who have a 'Level 3' in a skill may also award that skill to other members, using the 'Award Skill' button below.</p>
