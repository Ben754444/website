### Request to release feature

#### Issue summary
Briefly describe the issue this merge request resolves. Don't simply copy over the text from the ticket - use this section to summarise it in your own words. This gives context to the code review.

#### Work included
Describe what work this merge request includes. There's no need to list line-by-line (the change list will do that); instead just summarise each bit of functionality that's been added, edited or removed. Link these back to the issue summary if you can. 

The "why" is just as (if not more) important than the "what" - so please include any reasoning behind any decisions you made to help the reviewer understand why you've done it that way.

Don't be afraid to use bullet points here!

#### Testing
Outline how you should test this piece of work, including any pre-requisites (eg, any new environment variables? do you need any API keys or new accounts? do you need any resources?).

Describe how to test both happy and unhappy paths. What are the expected outcomes? Are there any possible quirks you discovered during development?
